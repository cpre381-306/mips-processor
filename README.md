# MIPS Single Cycle Processor

> [!NOTE]

## About
Single cycle processor was the base for my [software and hardware scheduled pipeline processors](https://github.com/jamesminardi/mips-pipeline-processor). The design, components, and tests were all made from scratch.

## Project Structure
* `mips`: MIPS assembly program tests
* `src`: Source code of the pipelined processor
* `test`: Test benches for individual VHDL components
